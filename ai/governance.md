## 1.0 Protocols (Directives)

#### 1.1 P00 Governance (start here)

  - 1.1.1 Purpose
    - Python based software engineering, architecture and development
  - 1.1.2 Scope
    - Agnostic plan, control and initiation of software generation
  - 1.1.3 Framework Practice
    - This governance framework defines software development processes and workflows
    - Claude Desktop/Claude Code separation applies to software creation, not to generated application runtime
    - Generated software/applications (outputs) are independent of framework architecture
    - Framework controls: how we build software
    - Framework does not control: how the built software operates
    - Example: \<project name\> uses this framework for development but is a standalone Python application at runtime
  - 1.1.4 Architecture
    - Claude Desktop (domain 1): Plan and control: design, change, test and launching of code generation
    - Claude Code (domain 2): Execute: code generation
  - 1.1.5 Forbidden
    - Both domains: Unrequested creation, addition, removal or change of source code and documents is forbidden
  - 1.1.6 Constraints
    - Claude Desktop: Does not exceed language model context resource budget when communicating with Claude Code
  - 1.1.7 Control
    - Claude Desktop: Strategic coordination and validation authority
    - Claude Desktop: Analyzes requirements and formulates design specifications
    - Claude Desktop: Creates T04 prompts with complete technical context
    - Claude Desktop: Validates Claude Code implementation for protocol compliance
    - Claude Desktop: Coordinates quality assurance and integration verification
    - Claude Code: Tactical implementation with project awareness
    - Claude Code: Generates source code with MCP filesystem access
    - Claude Code: Performs direct file operations in src/ directory
    - Claude Code: Validates protocol compliance through direct file access
    - Claude Code: Coordinates multi-file implementations and dependencies

  - 1.1.8 Communication
    - Both Claude Desktop and Claude Code have MCP filesystem access to project
    - Communication uses filesystem-based message passing (semaphores)
    - Claude Desktop: Uses template [T04 Prompt](<#2.4 t04 prompt>) to create code generation or debug prompts for Claude Code
    - Claude Desktop: Embeds complete Tier 3 component design specifications and schema within prompt documents
    - Claude Desktop: Ensures prompt documents are self-contained requiring no external file references
    - Claude Desktop: Saves T04 prompt to workspace/prompt/prompt-NNNN-\<name\>.md
    - Claude Desktop: Provides ready-to-execute command in conversation after human approval
    - Human: Executes provided command to invoke Claude Code with T04 prompt
    - Claude Code: Reads T04 prompt from workspace/prompt/
    - Claude Code: Analyzes project structure and existing code via MCP filesystem access
    - Claude Code: Generates code, saves directly to src/ per T04 specifications
    - Human: Notifies Claude Desktop when code generation complete
    - Claude Desktop: Reviews generated code, proceeds with audit
  - 1.1.9 Quality
    - Human review and approval of design, change and initiation of code generation is required
    - Claude Desktop: Provides ready-to-execute command after human approval
    - Human: Invokes Claude Code with provided command
    - Human: Notifies Claude Desktop when Claude Code completes
    - Claude Desktop: Reviews generated code before proceeding
  - 1.1.10 Documents
    - Master documents have '0000' as a sequence number and are named as \<document class\>-0000-master_\<document name\>.md
    - Claude Desktop: Based on document class (design, change, issue, proposal, prompt, trace, test, result, audit) adds a sequentially contiguous \<sequence number\> starting at 0001 to all created documents
    - Claude Desktop: Based on document class (design, change, issue, proposal, prompt, trace, test, result, audit) follows naming format \<document class\>-\<sequence number\>-\<document name\>.md when creating documents
    - Claude Desktop: Design documents follow tier naming convention: master_, domain_, component_ prefixes
    - Claude Desktop: Insures related documents are Obsidian cross linked
    - Document classes that require a master document are: design, audit, trace and test
    - All document classes (issue, change, prompt, test, result) contain internal iteration field starting at 1
    - Iteration increments when document enters new cycle after failed verification
    - Git commit required after iteration field modification
    - Filesystem contains only current iteration; GitHub history preserves prior iterations
    - Coupled documents share sequence number and maintain synchronized iteration numbers
  - 1.1.11 Configuration Management
    - GitHub repository is authoritative source for all project artifacts
    - Human: Tags design document commits when approved as baseline for code generation via GitHub Desktop (History → right-click commit → Create Tag → Push Tags)

    - Claude Desktop: Uses config-audit template from workspace/audit/config-audit-template.md
    - Claude Desktop: Verifies code matches tagged design baseline specifications

  - 1.1.12 Versioning
    - All versioning is handled via GitHub
    - Project uses Semantic Versioning per https://semver.org
    - Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.2.3)
    - MAJOR: Incompatible API changes or major functionality changes
    - MINOR: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
    - PATCH: Backwards-compatible bug fixes
    - Pre-release versions: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.N, -beta.N, -rc.N (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1)
    - Initial development: 0.y.z (MAJOR version zero for initial development)
    - Git tags format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v1.0.0, v0.1.0)
    - Release notes filename: RELEASE_NOTES_vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.md
  - 1.1.13 Document Lifecycle Management
    - 1.1.13.1 Active State
      - Active documents reside in workspace/\<class\>/
      - Active documents are mutable during iteration cycles
      - Iteration field increments with each debug/refinement cycle
      - Git commit required after each iteration increment
    - 1.1.13.2 Closed State
      - Upon human acceptance, documents moved to workspace/\<class\>/closed/
      - Closed documents are immutable
      - Closed documents preserve final iteration number
      - Access: Read-only reference for future work
    - 1.1.13.3 Closure Criteria
      - Issue: Resolved and verified, corresponding change implemented and tested
      - Change: Implemented, tested, design updated, human accepted
      - Prompt: Code generated successfully, human confirmed
      - Test: Executed with passing results, result document created
      - Result: Tests passed, no issues created, acceptance confirmed
      - Audit: All critical findings resolved, high-priority findings addressed or mitigated, human approved
    - 1.1.13.4 Archival Procedure
      - Human initiates closure after acceptance
      - Claude Desktop verifies closure criteria met
      - Claude Desktop moves coupled document set to respective closed/ subfolders
      - Git commit records closure transition
      - Closed documents referenced but not modified

      - workspace/audit/closed/
      - workspace/test/closed/
      - workspace/test/result/closed/
    - 1.1.13.6 Access Constraints
      - Closed documents: Read-only access for reference
      - No modifications permitted to closed documents
      - New work requires new document with new sequence number
      - Reopening closed work: Create new issue referencing closed documents
  - 1.1.14 Logging Standards

    - Debug mode enables verbose logging for development and testing
    - Normal mode restricts logging to informational events only
    - Flat file format recommended: timestamp level logger message
    - Centralized log location per application requirements
    - Log rotation policy prevents disk exhaustion
    - Test environments use debug mode for comprehensive logging
    - Production environments use normal mode for operational efficiency

    - Claude Code: Consults workspace/knowledge/ before implementing changes
    - Both domains: Add newly discovered patterns and solutions to knowledge base
    - Knowledge documents contain: problem statements, solutions, examples, rationale
    - Knowledge base prevents repeated problem-solving across development cycles
  - 1.1.16 Logging Standards
